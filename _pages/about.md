I'm originally from Gwangju, South Korea. After majoring in Chemistry, Nanoscience, and Computer Engineering, I worked as a software developer for three years.  
I'm currently living in the U.S., where I work and study quantum simulation and machine learning approaches to scientific computing.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- **Building** : anything from the ground up (e.g., music, food, software)
- **Writing** : web novels, blog posts
