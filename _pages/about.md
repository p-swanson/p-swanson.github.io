I am a PhD student at [Theoretical Chemistry Institute](https://tci.chem.wisc.edu/) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I study molecular dynamics and machine learning. My PhD advisor is [Prof. Xuhui Huang](https://huang.chem.wisc.edu/).
Prior to that, I completed my BS in Chemistry at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I worked on molecular docking methods in [Prof. Yi Qin Gao](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/gaoyq/)'s group. 

My research focuses on developing physics-informed AI methods for biochemical discovery. In particular, I am interested in utilizing generative models for molecular simulation, aiming to overcome the timescale limitations in our understanding of complex molecular systems, and thereby facilitating the rational design of molecules. Besides, I collaborate with experimental researchers on *in silico* directed evolution for protein engineering.

- **Molecular Simulation:** Dynamics, Multiscale Modelling, Enhanced Sampling.
- **Machine Learning:** Generative Models, Geometrical Deep Learning.
